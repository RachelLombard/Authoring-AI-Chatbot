Interfascia
===========

__Interfascia__ is a graphical user interface library for the [Processing][p5]

widgets like text fields, buttons, checkboxes, sliders, etc. Interfascia
automatically handles interactions within the collection of widgets and sends
event messages to your project. More information and documentation can be
found at the [Interfascia web site][interfascia].

Interfascia is a project initiated and maintained by [Brendan Berg][berg]
and released under the [GNU LGPL][lgpl].

In addition to building a solid GUI library, it is also vital that we create
