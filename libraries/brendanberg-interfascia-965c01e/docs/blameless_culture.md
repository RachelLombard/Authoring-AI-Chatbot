Blameless Culture
=================

This is a work in progress. Stay tuned.

# Three Tips

- __Assume good will.__  Contributors make decisions based on what they
believe is right for the project.

- __Identify causes, not culprits.__ Accountability happens naturally as
people learn the facts.
Focus on exploring what happenedâ€”--and recognize that in complex systems,
there's rarely one root cause.

- __Take your time.__ People used to blaming cultures may take time to come
out of their shell and share mistakes and learnings freely.
